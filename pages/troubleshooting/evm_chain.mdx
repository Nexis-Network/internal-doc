# Troubleshooting EVM Chain

We have two chains running: an EVM Chain and a Native Chain.

- **EVM Chain RPC:** [https://evm-testnet.nexis.network](https://evm-testnet.nexis.network)
- **Native Chain RPC:** [https://api.testnet.nexis.network](https://api.testnet.nexis.network)

## How to Identify Whether the EVM Chain is Not Working

1. **Check the EVM RPC:**
   - Visit [https://evm-testnet.nexis.network](https://evm-testnet.nexis.network). If it throws an error, the EVM chain is down.
   
2. **Check Transactions and Balances:**
   - If transactions are paused but balances are loading in MetaMask, the Native RPC is up and running. The issue is likely with the EVM bridge.

### Checking the EVM Bridge

Currently, the EVM bridge runs on an AWS instance named `nexis-testnet-explorer`. To check the logs:

1. Open the tmux session:
    ```sh
    tmux attach -t bridge
    ```
2. View the logs:
   - If the logs are empty, the bridge is not running.
   - To start the bridge, use the following commands:
     ```sh
     export RUST_LOG="debug,hyper=info,tokio_reactor=info,reqwest=info"
     /home/ubuntu/nexis/target/release/evm-bridge ~/.wallet/my-keypair.json https://api.testnet.nexis.network 0.0.0.0:8545 2370
     ```

## What is the EVM Bridge For?

The EVM bridge wraps EVM transactions to the native chain and passes them to [https://api.testnet.nexis.network](https://api.testnet.nexis.network). Ensure `my-keypair.json` is always funded as it acts as the fee payer.
